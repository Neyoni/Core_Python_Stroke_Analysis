# Stroke Risk Analysis System
# No external dependencies required - Pure Python implementation
# Python 3.8+ required

# This project was implemented without using any external libraries
# as per assignment requirements. All functionality is built using
# Python's standard library only.

# The following were explicitly NOT used (as per requirements):
# pandas
# numpy  
# csv (module)
# Any other high-level data processing libraries

# Only Python's built-in functions and file I/O were utilized.
